# EGT_RZ
A combination of R Aragon's EGT and the R Zero paper by Tencent

Below is a concrete, engineering-level analysis of your Embedded GAN-in-Transformer (EGT) concept given the materials you shared. The design summary is anchored to the technical description (GAN critics embedded inside a decoder-only GPT, LoRA updates, EMA teacher, wake/sleep with a replay buffer) and uses the R-Zero paper (as the inspirational “adversarial/self-play” reference) when suggesting training improvements and curriculum mechanics.  &#x20;

# 1) Model size needed (in-domain corpus, strong language skills; minimal general knowledge)

Because EGT fine-tunes only LoRA adapters on a frozen base model, the *effective* model size is the base GPT’s parameter count, not the adapter count. Choosing that base size should follow (i) corpus size and (ii) target difficulty. A practical rule is the “Chinchilla-style” compute-optimal heuristic:

> **Params (billions) ≈ Tokens (billions) ÷ 20.**

This prevents over- or under-parameterization for the data volume. Applying that to plausible in-domain corpora:

* **If your curated domain corpus ≈ 0.2B tokens (200M):** params ≈ 0.01B by the rule, but such tiny models underperform linguistically. For strong fluency on specialized text, I recommend a **1–2B base** with LoRA (adapters at \~0.5–2% of base).
* **If corpus ≈ 1.0B tokens:** params ≈ 0.05B by the rule; in practice, a **3B base** hits a nice balance of fluency, capacity for adversarial training signals (your critics), and manageable cost.
* **If corpus ≈ 3.0B tokens:** params ≈ 0.15B by the rule; for higher ceiling and longer-context domains, a **7B base** is justified.

**Recommendation:**

* For most domain deployments with 100–1000M high-quality tokens, pick a **3B base**.
* If your domain is narrow but syntactically demanding (legal, medical abstracts, formal specs) and you have ≥1B tokens, prefer **\~7B**.
* Use **LoRA** (as you already propose) so you preserve the frozen linguistic competence, keep trainable parameters small, and reduce optimizer/memory, while your forward/backward still flows through the full network.&#x20;

# 2) Training cost for that EGT size

A decent first-order FLOPs estimate for decoder-only LLM training is:

> **FLOPs ≈ 6 × (params) × (tokens)**

(works for BF16 training; attention overheads, activation checkpointing and data pipeline add a constant-factor overhead). Below I show three concrete scenarios, counting full-model forward/backward (LoRA saves memory/optimizer state; compute is still near full pass):

| Scenario        | Base size | Train tokens | Total FLOPs |  PF-days | \~A100-80GB GPU-days (150 TF/s effective) | \~H100-SXM GPU-days (800 TF/s effective) |
| --------------- | --------: | -----------: | ----------: | -------: | ----------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------: |
| Small           |        1B |         0.2B |      1.2e18 |    0.014 |                                      0.09 |                                     0.02 |
| **Recommended** |    **3B** |     **1.0B** |  **1.8e19** | **0.21** |                                  **1.39** |                                 **0.26** |
| Large           |        7B |         3.0B |     1.26e20 |     1.46 |                                      9.72 |                                     1.82 |

Notes:

* **PF-days** uses 1 PFLOP/s-day = 8.64e19 FLOPs.
* GPU-day rows assume sustained training throughput (real-world wall-clock will vary with sequence length, context window, optimizer, ZeRO/FSDP sharding, etc.).
* LoRA keeps optimizer/memory small, but **compute is still dominated by full forward/backward** through the frozen base, so plan capacity accordingly.&#x20;

# 3) Targeted improvements to lower cost and raise accuracy

**A. Make the “adversary” curriculum more principled (R-Zero-style).**
The wake/sleep loop and embedded critics are already adversarial. You can *replace or augment* parts of the adversarial signal with **self-play curriculum** that provably targets the model’s decision boundary:

* **Challenger/Solver co-evolution:** In the wake phase, generate “hard” prompts by maximizing Solver uncertainty (e.g., self-consistency near 50% agreement across multiple samples) and *diversify* them with a repetition penalty. Then filter to an “informative band” (neither too easy nor too hard) before feeding the sleep phase. This mirrors R-Zero’s reward and filtering mechanics and removes hand-crafted heuristics in the replay buffer. &#x20;
* **Why this helps:** R-Zero reports consistent gains across backbones (e.g., +5.5 points on math suites for an 8B base) by iteratively training on questions tuned to the solver’s frontier. You can emulate the same *within EGT*, letting the embedded critics learn on genuinely “edge” distributions rather than random negatives.&#x20;

**B. Swap (or mix) adversarial loss with verifiable or consistency-based signals when available.**

* Where you can *verify outputs deterministically* (code unit tests, schema-validated JSON, constrained extraction), add an **RLVR head** (binary verifier reward) as an auxiliary target in the sleep step. This stabilizes learning and reduces the GAN discriminator’s burden.&#x20;
* Where outputs are open-ended but structured, add **self-consistency rewards** (agreement across diverse rationales) or **entropy-minimization** regularizers to sharpen decision boundaries (documented as effective in recent label-free RL).&#x20;

**C. Tighten the replay buffer into a *prioritized curriculum*.**

* Replace heuristic quality with **uncertainty-targeted scores** (e.g., keep items whose solver agreement is in \[40%,70%]) and **diversity penalties** (BLEU-distance clustering) *before* you train the critics/generator. This directly brings the buffer policy in line with the R-Zero advantage.&#x20;
* Track **label reliability**: if you use pseudo-labels (majority vote), monitor their accuracy—R-Zero observes pseudo-label quality drops as questions get harder; reject or re-generate low-reliability samples.&#x20;

**D. Make the embedded critics more sample-efficient.**

* **Multi-view critics:** keep the per-layer MLP critics (good) and add a **contrastive head** that discriminates real/fake pairs *and* pulls semantically close reals together. This reduces mode collapse risk without increasing generator size (EMA teacher already helps). &#x20;
* **Hard-negative mining:** sample “borderline” fake continuations (near critic decision threshold) for extra critic steps. This is cheap and raises critic calibration.

**E. Keep compute low with systems tricks (no accuracy trade-off).**

* **LoRA already**: retain it; consider **QLoRA** (8-bit/4-bit base weights) for larger bases (e.g., 7B) to fit memory while maintaining nearly identical compute.
* **FlashAttention-2, BF16, fused ops**: adopt these (R-Zero used BF16 + FlashAttn-2 for throughput).&#x20;
* **Activation checkpointing** and **sequence-length curriculum** (begin with shorter contexts, grow to full) to improve tokens/sec and stabilize updates early.

**F. When you *do* have small labeled pockets, combine with self-play.**
R-Zero shows that mid-training with self-play *followed by* supervised fine-tuning yields additive gains (+2.35 points vs. supervised alone). Operationally, that means: (i) run a few wake/sleep iterations to shape the frontier; (ii) finish with a brief SFT/RLVR pass on gold data.&#x20;

## Design recap

* **Architecture:** decoder-only GPT as **Generator**; **embedded MLP critics** tapping intermediate blocks; **LoRA** on projections only; **EMA teacher** for stability.  &#x20;
* **Training loop:** **Wake** (generate and store prompt/continuation + quality score) → **Sleep** (train critics on real vs. fake; train generator with adversarial + KL-to-EMA). Tighten this with R-Zero-style uncertainty targeting and diversity filtering for better stability and sample efficiency.  &#x20;

## What I would deploy first

1. **Base size:** 3B with LoRA (rank 8–16), context 8k (or the task’s natural context).
2. **Data budget:** \~1B in-domain tokens (deduped, document-aware splits).
3. **Curriculum:** Replace heuristic replay scoring with **uncertainty-band + BLEU-diversity filter**; keep a 60/40 hard/medium ratio.&#x20;
4. **Losses:** adversarial + KL-to-EMA (as you have), plus **consistency bonus** (agreement across 4–8 samples) where verifiable labels aren’t available; **RLVR head** where you can verify. &#x20;
5. **Systems:** BF16, FlashAttn-2, activation checkpointing; DDP/FSDP with ZeRO-3; mixed precision for critics.&#x20;

Determine the corpus size (tokens after dedupe) and planned context length, to pin the base size and determine an exact budget in PF-days and cluster hours, and sketch a concrete training schedule (steps, LR/KL schedules, EMA decay, LoRA ranks) tailored to EGT.

We take notebook and packaged the recommended upgrades into a clean, drop-in module, you can paste it into a new cell and wire it up with minimal disruption.

The changes contain:

* A **prioritized, diversity-aware replay buffer** (uncertainty-band curriculum, R-Zero–style).
* A **wake** sampler that generates **K** candidates per prompt, computes **agreement/entropy** (uncertainty), and keeps items in a target band; it also does **diversity filtering** (token-Jaccard).
* **Hard-negative mining** for the embedded critics in the **sleep** step.
* Existing **EMA teacher + KL** regularization retained; hooks for **RLVR** (verifier) are included as a light, optional head.
* **System knobs**: bf16 autocast on CUDA; optional activation checkpointing inside blocks.

You don’t need to refactor the model; the code reuses the `TinyGPT`, `Config`, `generate`, `EMA`, and `kl_divergence`. It patches only the training loop and the replay logic. The integration steps are at the bottom of the canvas file; in brief:

1. Paste the code from the canvas into a new cell **after** the existing class/func definitions.
2. Instantiate `EGTSystemRZ` instead of `EGTSystem`, e.g.:

```python
cfg = TrainCfgRZ(
    device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu',
    block_size=256,
    critic_layers=(1,3,5),
    use_bf16=True,
    use_ckpt=True,
    k_samples=6,
    uncert_band=(0.30, 0.60),
    hard_frac=0.60
)

tok = TinyBPETokenizer(vocab_size=1024)  # train on the corpus as you do now
sys_rz = EGTSystemRZ(tokenizer=tok, base_cfg_class=Config, tiny_gpt_class=TinyGPT, gen_fn=generate, cfg=cfg)
```

3. The seeding/training is replaced with:

```python
# Wake (self-play) seeding
for _ in range(1000):
    p = random.choice(PROMPTS)   # or stream real prompts
    txt, uncert, kept = sys_rz.wake_step(p)

# Sleep (training)
for epoch in range(50):
    stats = sys_rz.sleep_epoch(steps_D=50, steps_G=20, batch_size=8)
    print(epoch, stats)
```

The LoRA-only training and embedded critics stay intact; you simply gain uncertainty-targeted sampling, diversity control, and harder negatives.

# Recommended English training sets (≈1B tokens target for a 3B base)

Below is a practical recipe to reach \~1.0–1.2B **English** tokens with strong language quality, oriented to domain-general writing skills (no need for broad world knowledge beyond prose and structure). The mix is intentionally redundant-free and license-aware.

### A. High-quality web prose (≈ 450M tokens)

* **Refined/filtered CommonCrawl slices** (e.g., RefinedWeb / FineWeb-style English): \~300M
  Use a rigorous filter (fastText lang-id, perplexity filtering, boilerplate removal) and **near-dedupe** (MinHash / SimHash) against everything else in the mix.
* **OpenWebText2** or similar Reddit-linked web text: \~150M
  Good for idiomatic phrasing and coherence.

### B. Encyclopedic + neutral style (≈ 220M)

* **Wikipedia (EN)** latest dump: \~200M
  Superb for grammar and structure; dedupe by URL/title paragraphs.
* **Wikibooks/Wikihow small sample**: \~20M
  Adds stepwise instructional style and headings.

### C. Books & long-form (≈ 200M)

* **Project Gutenberg (EN, public domain)** curated: \~150M
  Filter aggressively for OCR noise; keep a balanced era/genre mix.
* **BookCorpus-style public domain replacements**: \~50M
  Only include clearly license-clean items.

### D. News & magazines (≈ 100–150M)

* **English newswire** (CC-News-like) across multiple outlets: 100–150M
  Enforce publisher diversity; remove wire duplicates; keep recent years for modern style without chasing factual recency.

### E. Q\&A / formal writing (≈ 100–150M)

* **StackExchange English-only verticals** (Writing, Academia, English): \~60–80M
* **ArXiv abstracts (EN)** for syntax and formal tone: \~40–60M (abstracts only; exclude LaTeX bodies to avoid math bias if not needed).

> **Quality pipeline (crucial):**
>
> 1. Normalize & segment → 2) Lang-ID (fastText) → 3) Boilerplate & short-doc filter → 4) PPL filtering with a strong EN LM → 5) **Near-dedupe across *all* sources** (MinHash/LSH) → 6) Toxicity/PII scrubbing → 7) **Document-aware train/val/test splits**.

This mix gives \~1.0–1.2B tokens of **clean English** with varied registers: expository, instructional, narrative, and news. That’s ideal for your 3B-parameter base with LoRA adapters. If your *domain* has a corpus, allocate \~30–50% of tokens to it and reduce open-web portions proportionally.

## Notes on the upgrades you just gained

* **Uncertainty-band curriculum (R-Zero–style):** the wake step now samples **K** outputs per prompt, measures **agreement** and **entropy**, and retains examples in a **mid-uncertainty band** while mixing in “hard” items (> upper bound). This focuses sleep-phase training exactly on your model’s decision boundary.
* **Diversity control:** the replay buffer rejects near-duplicates by default and keeps a small exemplar set for fast Jaccard checks; you avoid collapsing onto a few patterns.
* **Hard-negative mining for critics:** in the GAN term, the generator is trained primarily against **ambiguous fakes** (critic logits near 0), which yields more informative gradients.
* **EMA + KL preserved:** you still distill stability from the teacher; the feature-matching term remains as gentle regularization.
* **Hooks for RLVR:** if a subset of tasks is verifiable (unit tests / JSON schema / regex), you can add a verifier function and plug a tiny RLVR head to incorporate a binary reward without changing the generator.

If you’d like, give me a short snippet of the `PROMPTS`/data loader you’re using, and I’ll tailor the wake-sampling (e.g., per-domain stopping rules, per-section sampling, or per-prompt K).
